### 🚀 [Space Mission](https://github.com/linhnde/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/space_mission.ipynb){:target="_blank"}
An incredibly rich dataset from [nextspaceflight.com](https://nextspaceflight.com/launches/){:target="_blank"} that includes all the space missions since the beginning of Space Race between the USA and the Soviet Union in 1957! It has data on the mission status (success/failure), the cost of the mission, the number of launches per country, and much much more.

### 💰 [Earning Predict](https://github.com/linhnde/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/earning_predict.ipynb){:target="_blank"}
The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997-2011 dataset is one of the most important databases available to social scientists working with US data.
It allows scientists to look at the determinants of earnings as well as educational attainment and has incredible relevance for government policy.
When we have a better understanding how these variables affect education and earnings we can also formulate more suitable government policies.

###  🦄 Unicorn Companies
#### [Discovery](https://github.com/linhnde/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/unicorn_companies_discovery.ipynb){:target="_blank"}
The data I will use for this task provides information on over 1,000 unicorn companies, including their industry, country, year founded, and select investors. I will use this information to gain insights into how and when companies reach this prestigious milestone and to make recommentations for next steps to the investing firm.

#### [Structure](https://github.com/linhnde/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/unicorn_companies_structure.ipynb){:target="_blank"}
We work with the unicorn companies dataset, discovering characteristics of the data, structuring the data in ways that will help us draw meaningful insights, and using visualizations to analyze the data. Ultimately, we will draw conclusions about what significant trends or patterns we find in the dataset.
